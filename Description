Bird species classification is the process of using machine learning and computer vision techniques to identify and categorize different species of birds based on their visual characteristics. By analyzing images of birds, models can extract features and patterns to accurately classify bird species. This classification is vital for ecological research, wildlife monitoring, and conservation efforts. Advancements in deep learning and the availability of large annotated datasets have improved the accuracy of bird species classification models. Challenges include variations in lighting, pose, and background clutter. Ongoing research focuses on methods like transfer learning and data augmentation to enhance classification performance and contribute to avian biodiversity understanding and conservation.
